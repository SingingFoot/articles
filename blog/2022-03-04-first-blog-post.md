Everyone knows what is going on in Ukraine, but not everyone is deeply aware of it. In my novel "Kaharlyk" (2012-2014), I foresaw the current situation in detail and showed what it could lead to in terms of implications for global culture. In 2022, the vast majority of humanity entered the metamodern era, which is characterized by the following features:

---

1. Total trust in everything. Both truth and falsehood have the same rights and the same value in the human mind, which was founded in postmodernism, but in postmodern times there was a distance: we believe in falsehood, although we realize that it is a lie. Now this distance is gone.
2. Normal coexistence and symbiosis of radical opposites. Poisoned FSB political oppositionist Navalny calls his killers and immediately spreads the phone conversation online. After his arrest, he continued to be active in the media, posting on Facebook every day from behind bars and writing columns for "Echo of Moscow" radio station. Kiva's Ukrainian anti-terrorist operation soldier turns out to be a Putinist. The Russian-speaking comedian and Jew Zelensky, who voiced Paddington Bear, became the president and savior of the Ukrainian nation.
3. Flickering. Radical opposites not only coexist, but are one essence, due to the fact that they are chaotically or consciously switched.
4. Complete elimination of taboos. We remember the existence of taboos and what it means to break taboos, but today this knowledge makes no sense because we cannot apply it.
5. Complete virtualization of the medium. Any information is no longer dependent on the material medium. It follows that it can be edited in any way, and therefore it is almost impossible to establish the original, so the meaning of the original is lost.
6. Most people spend most of their time online. This has led to the formation of a special online consciousness: changing, dynamic and fluid. Such consciousness perfectly perceives all the above phenomena of metamodernism.

Metamodernism is completely unacceptable to people stuck in the situation of modernism, which was best embodied in the totalitarian dictatorships of the twentieth century: Communist and Nazi. By 2022, Russia has become the most dangerous and influential focus of modernism. During the first 10 years after the collapse of the modernist project of the USSR, Russia began a rapid movement through postmodernism, in which it existed partly since the 1960s, then - metamodern started, but modern inertia won. This happened for a number of very very inherent to modernism reasons:

---

1. Remains of archaic culture. The Russian occupation army still uses weapons made in the 1960s and 1980s. Famous photo with a lid from a box with grenades, whith the date of manufacture "1987". The same thing happens with all other material culture.
2. Distrust of the truth, instead of ritualizing lies. Lies are not simply declared true, but affirmed in the role of truth through a number of public holidays, festivals, fairs.
3. Normalization of lies. Lying is now not just a lie, but a "disinformation of the enemy", absolutely necessary for victory.
4. Availability and readiness to use the last argument - nuclear weapons. Hence the nuclear blackmail and the possibility of an all-around defense of modern archaism, which either fights for its right to exist or destroys the whole world with it.

---

Thus, the first global collision of metamodernism with the remnants of archaic modernism is taking place in Ukraine. Modernism, as a paradigm, lost its meaning in the 1950s of the XX century and became a purely decorative shell, a kind of home decoration. You can no longer use the meanings of modernism, they have no way to affect your life. You can wear a Hitler or Stalin mask, but you cannot become  Hitler or Stalin. It is because of the depletion of the meaning of modernism in Russia that there are problems with the ideological justification of aggression: the letter "Z" on its tanks literally means "Zombie". The Russian military often behaves like a zombie, unaware of what is happening in reality and where they are, following the clearly criminal orders of the same zombie commanders. Russian zombie modernism is not moving on its own, but by inertia, because in Russia it received a very strong push and this push was not offset by the defeat in World War II, as was the case with modernist Nazism in Germany. The inertia of Russian zombie modernism leads to the following conclusions:

---

1. In the absence of inner meaning and push the zombie-modern will quickly lose momentum and stop itself.
2. Any attempt to stop the zombie-modern will lead to its even faster stop.
3. Do not underestimate the momentum of the zombie-modern in Russia - it is still quite powerful and can last for years under the protection of the last argument. 

---

In these circumstances, the transformation of Russia into a new huge North Korea is quite real. However, metamodern in itself every second has a devastating effect on modernism in all possible directions. It is unlikely that under such conditions, this zombie reserve will last for a long time.
